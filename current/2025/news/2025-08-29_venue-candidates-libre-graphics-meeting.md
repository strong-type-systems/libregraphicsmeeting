    After the LGM 2025 in Nuremberg, we went home with a couple of "vague" proposals for hosting next year's LGM.
---

Because of the short preparation period, Lasse was asked if he would agree to organize a second LGM in Nuremberg next year. He accepted to consider it.

August 20th was the soft deadline for proposing a candidature and during the bi-weekly LGM online meetings, the only concrete proposal we had, was the one for a second LGM in Nuremberg.


## Vote

We are now asking the community to vote for this proposal, cheer for it, and/or raise your concerns:

then join and have small online LGM party on September 3rd:<br />

## Heads Up

As soon as this decision is settled, we'll start the process for finding our 2027 location.
