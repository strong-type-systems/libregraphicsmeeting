## Chat â€“ Matrix and IRC

* We have a **Matrix** channel at [#lgm:kde.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23lgm:kde.org).
* We are also on **IRC** at "`#lgm`" on [irc.libera.chat](https://libera.chat/guides/connect). The channel is bridged with the Matrix one.

## LGM mailing list

The [Libre Graphic Meeting mailling list](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/libre-graphics-meeting)
is  the place for the discussion among the LGM organization team. Each
member of the team should be subscribed. Other people can subscribe and
follow the discussion and give occasional contributions (if your contributions
become regular, you should probably get into the team).

Every mail gets read, but it might get some time to the relevant people to read your inquiry.

## Organization
