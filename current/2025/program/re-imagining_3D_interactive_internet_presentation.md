Hubs is an open-source interactive browser based 3D meeting space. It is
now fully integrated in Blender 3D, which is using an extended version of
the gltf format. An extension allows you to attach all the basic components
to objects, like particles, UV animations, water and much more. But you can
also share links, videos and audio right inside your 3D rooms.

Soon another feature was added to the gtlf exporter, the Behavior Graph.
It enables interactivity via node-based logic and is only available in
Blender 3D. It is the very feature we would like to present to you. If
you are used to Blenderâ€™s nodes graphs, you might feel right at home.
However managing interactivity creates a distinct difference, since every
node needs to get triggered by events, be it player interaction or just
timer based.
