A developer talk about coming up with a new file format for [Drawpile](https://drawpile.net/)
with the focus being on the findings and ideas that would be useful for
other programs as well. Some of those ideas are already implemented and
have brought a massive speedup in file saving and loading, some wilder
ideas like continuous autosave with history-altering time-travel are in
various states of currently still being worked on, but sufficiently cool
to talk about anyway.
