Come learn about some ways to create waterfalls for video games!
Inspired by a variety of waterfalls in the Pacific Northwest of the USA,
Tom has been playing around with different ways to create waterfalls in
the open source Godot game engine, with the help of other open source
software such as Blender, Krita, and Gimp. Video game fluid flow is a
complex subject, and this talk will outline various methods to cheat so
that you don't really have to know complex math to make something
acceptable.
