It is well known that PDF has become a very popular file format.
Everyone use it everyday for many purposes.

In this context, many software can produce PDF. Still, as graphic
designers, we must often deal with provided PDF that doesn’t match our
needs, because one PDF isn’t worth another. On the other side,
printshops also come with their own standards and constraints.


How can we deal with theses everyday outcomes and be sure our PDF will
match the delivery standards, using only free softwares?

In this presentation, we will talk about several PDF tools trying to
reach this goal of giving the right PDF to the right person.
