At the 2014 edition of LGM in Leipzig I've shown the evolution on
printed circuit board design with a special focus on fonts, which were
mostly constrained by the technical capabilities of the tools available
at that time.

Ten years later, however, there now is a strong Free Software
option for designing your own PCBs and there is a growing community
of artists using PCBs as a medium for artistic expression, a lot of
them actually using KiCAD for the design work.

I want to showcase examples of PCBs where the properties of PCBs are
used to create visually appealing hardware. I'll also give a quick tour
through KiCAD to show the limits of its capabilities as well as its
strong side for graphical artworks.
