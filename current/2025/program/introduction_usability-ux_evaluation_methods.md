The session will start with an introduction to the topic of usability and user experience (UX),
including the human centered design process (HCD) and design thinking (DT). After having laid
out the foundation, a brief overview of different usability evaluation methods is given. The main
part of the presentation is about introducing two often used methods: On the one hand the heuristic
evaluation as an example of a usability inspection method, and usability testing on the other hand.
Both methods can be used to find (potential) usability problems in a software. Whereas a heuristic
evaluation is conducted by an expert following a check-list, a usability test needs end users who
fulfill tasks to be conducted. After describing how both methods can be used individually, also a
practical way to combining them is presented. The session will conclude with an overview of the
advantages and disadvantages of each method.

### Three takeaways of this session will be:

* A basic awareness for usability/UX and the importance of evaluating it
* An overview of the two major usability/UX evaluation methods heuristic evaluation and
usability testing
* A first idea how to use these methods for your/a software project

## Target group
