[Hyper 8](https://simonrepp.com/hyper8) is a static site generator for video, developed since 2023 and
first released in 2024. It uses a file-based, modular building block
system for authoring video sites ranging from single videos, to
playlists, to video collections of arbitrary hierarchical complexity.
Sites can be created and edited using Hyper 8's graphical user
interface, but also using nothing more than a terminal, file explorer
and text editor (or both). Due to their static nature, Hyper 8 sites are
inherently fast, maintenance-free, long-term archivable (also working
offline without a server, directly off disk) and compatible with pretty
much every webhost (thereby easy to publish and move).

In this talk I want to take you on a whirlwind tour around the project:
Who is this for? What was the motivation? How does this relate to
PeerTube? What is being developed at the moment? Where is it going in
the future? What are the challenges, learnings, anecdotes so far? And so
on. And of course also: Your questions!
