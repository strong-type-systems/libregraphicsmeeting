TypeRoof is **type tooling infrastructure**. It provides type proofing
applications, initially based on Video Proof and Variable Type Tools.
Now it also explores the world of general animation with type as a
principal actor, and document creation with general typography in mind
and typographical automations based on expert knowledge.

TypeRoof is **intended as a host** for all kinds of type related tools,
providing advanced methods of resource loading (i.e. fonts, data files)
saving and restoring state etc. – features which ad-hoc developed tools
typically miss out, as they are hard to do right on limited time.

TypeRoof is **Free/Libre Open Source Software and web based**, build mainly
with vanilla JavaScript and a few specialized dependencies. We are looking
for a community of users and developers who are interested in shaping its future.
