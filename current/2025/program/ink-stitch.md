Machine embroidery is becoming increasingly popular. It is more durable
than other customization methods for textiles and it adds a whole new
artistic dimension to the design. What makes it so beautiful, also adds
a new layer of complexity to the machine embroidery design creation
process. In this brief introduction we will learn a few basic
essentials on how to create machine embroidery designs using the Open
Source vector graphic software Inkscape along with the Ink/Stitch
extension.
