            First there was Flippaper, a project between a drafting table and a pinball. Take a few felt pens, draw a few shapes, press SCAN and ta-dah!, your drawing lights up. And it doesn't stop there: with the help of smoke, mirrors and a bit of tech, a ball appears on your drawing and reacts to it. A whole pinball emerges before your eyes. Through a language of shapes and colors, you're in charge of the gameplay and the look of your pinball.
Our aim is to release to the public the underlying tech that made this project a reality. This means both an open source code and an easy access to open hardware kits. We hope this will allow people to easily develop and play with this new interaction possibilities. During out time together, we will present this take on interactivity, Flippaper as its first result, and finally the library itself: its usages and possibilities.



Jéremie Cortial and Roman Miletitch are the left and right arms of Papertronics, aiming to find more natural and physical (who said carnal?) ways to interact with new technologies. Pigments on canvas was used by cavemen, so it felt good enough for us. Felt pen, paint or colored dot stickers on papers, colored food syrup on thin white waffle, graff on a wall, body paint on naked bodies... draw with any means necessary and grant your drawing life by pressing the magical SCAN button. What was static becomes dynamic, alive and utterly fun to play! A whole new world of messy interactions opens up. We're the welcoming committee.

            Building the LGM (Video) Archive
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            In the last year, there has been work on creating a video archive for the collected audio/visual recordings of 10 years of Libre Graphics Meetings.

Keeping legacy online resources alive is challenging, particularly for smaller-scale free culture organisations like the Libre Graphics Meeting. Changes occur not only to technical formats, capabilities and styles, but also to the surrounding social structures with changing contributors, skills, and desires. There is a diversity of kinds of documents produced and gathered (webpages of various vintage and provenance, slides, audio/video recordings, photos, external pages and social media). Currently organisations are forced to balance between maintaining resources in their own CMS and relying on external resources such as Google and the Internet archive. Are there technical means of embracing the distributed and diverse nature of the online video archive that don't risk falling between the perils of a single point of failure and over-reliance on the shifting interests of commercial (and often proprietary) clouds?

This workshop is a practical opportunity to improve the current state of the archive (helping to tag) and to share the files (the LGM hardrive), as well a moment to reflect on the state of online publishing and emerging possibilities for digital archiving.

           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            Intervention in public spaces with live audiovisuals based on smartphones involves an innovative proposal which connects the social aspects with appropriation and dynamization of spaces from a cultural transformation point of view in keeping with modern times we live in. Streamers' Corner  overcomes the difficulties of developing these shows without any need for previous production, using present technology in smartphones, for the purpose of recovering public spaces for audiovisual art. An electronic unplugged, in essence, with a minimum deployment and without production problems, previous tests, logistics, or noises. Its scheme is the following:

-Artists broadcast with their laptops to a computer which is in charge for processing live sound and images, convert them in a valid format for mobile phones, and for launch it through a private WIFI in a live atmosphere.

-The user connects from his smarthphone or tablet to that private WIFI and inmediately will listen the music and watch the real time sincronized visuals through his device. Since the communications are being transferred in a private environment, quality is very good and have lower latency levels. The result is that any person with a mobile phone with WIFI (smartphone (Android, IOS), tablet, iPad) and a pair of headphones can actually enjoy a audiovisual experience never raised until now, in environments that could not ever used before.

But the concept goes further beyond, since it is not necessary any power source. Artists use laptops batteries and an portable UPS to feed the communication electronics. So it is possible to set up a live show very quickly without practically any production.

How: By speaking into a microphone participants can create their own zines with a thermal printer. The spoken word will be automatically translated into text content and images will be pulled from image search. 

The participants will be therefore subject of the accumulating publication series and simultaneously active content providers. Thermo print has the characteristic of vanishing after a while.

            Scandanavian Institute for Computational Vandalism

           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            Today "computer vision" techniques are pervasive, integrated in smartphone cameras, surveillance systems, and cloud-based image search and tagging. Within the last 15 years, CV engineers increasingly use so-called "visual vocabularies" -- statistically determined clusters of algorithmically determined visual "features" -- to index and order image collections. But what precisely are these features in visual terms? What can visual art practices offer to (and receive from) these techniques?

This project is inspired by the Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism (SICV) founded by Asger Jorn shortly after leaving the Situationist International in 1961. The SICV was an art and research association experimenting with the practice of collage, the forces of photography, image archives, and political imaginaries. Today Computational Vandalism challenges the assumptions at the basis of computer vision, the discipline that programmatically ties together the visual and the mnemonic.

Work of the SICV has taken several forms: software "probes" (documented in blog form), installations, and publications. We will present an overview of the work, addressing the questions:
    What does computer vision have to offer to creative graphic design practitioners?
    When does a cheesy effect become a scientific instrument?
    How does an instrument of surveillance become a digital paintbrush?
    How is an image more than the sum of it's pixels?

            Visionaray: a modern C++ framework for prototyping ray tracing kernels
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            Visionaray is a framework to rapidly prototype algorithms that are based on shooting rays through 3-D space.

The following code excerpt shows what a simple, single-bounce real-time ray tracing algorithm may look like with Visionaray:


sched.frame([=](ray_type r) -&gt; color_type
{
    auto hit_rec = closest_hit(
        r,
        primitives.begin(),
        primitives.end());

    if (any(hit_rec.hit))
    {
        auto color = ...; // Calculate radiance
        return select(
            hit_rec.hit,
            color,
            background_color);
    }

    return background_color;
}, sparams);


sched is a scheduler instance that, depending on its specific type, generates primary rays, performs ray traversal based on so called ray traversal kernels, and writes the traversal result to a virtual or hardware frame buffer.

The lambda function parameter to sched's frame() member function is a ray traversal kernel which is written in platform independent C++ and is compiled to highly optimized machine code for the target platform -- e.g. CPUs with SIMD and multi-threading, GPGPUs with nVidia CUDA, or whole PC clusters with MPI. Kernels can be reused across platforms!

The user is expected to write custom kernels. While doing so, she has access to a set of optimized intrinsics for acceleration data structure traversal (e.g. closest_hit() from the example above), 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D texture access with higher-order interpolation, physically based surface shaders, or ray packet traversal for coherent rays (e.g. any() or select()).

Prototyping ray tracing algorithms with Visionaray is as easy as can be because the user can concentrate on the traversal algorithm rather than having to care about platform specific restrictions. This is accomplished through tight integration with libraries such as STL, Boost and Thrust.

When prototyping algorithms, using Visionaray is as simple as using a DSL. However, when optimization for a specific platform is necessary, the user may benefit from the flexibility of writing native C++ code and having access to platform specific libraries and language features.

Visionaray integrates with the scientific visualization software COVISE by means of a plugin for the OpenSceneGraph-based virtual reality renderer OpenCOVER. This relatively new side project will bridge the worlds of real-time global illumination and virtual reality.

The GNU Bourne-Again SHell was and still is a big inspiration towards a practise, not so much focussed on 'writing code' but 'embracing connectivity'.

            BIM stands for Building Information Modeling, the new heaven promised to architects, destinated to replace older, traditional CAD and unify all parts of a building project. The precise definition of BIM stays until today a bit blurry, and many still wonder where the big changes are. However, for the first time in a world traditionally ruled by software vendors, BIM is born with a foot in the open-source world, thanks, mainly, to an open file format, the IFC format, and the very active community around it, who, step by step, are turning this format into an unavoidable world standard.

This has many important consequences, a big one being the possibility to free the architectural design process from the paradigms fed by major software vendors, IFC being extremely down-to-earth, and allow architects to rethink their tools and workflows. Many open-source projects have blossomed around it, and with FreeCAD, we have a possibility to effectively deliver professional-level BIM work with a full A-to-Z control over our data, our methods and our workflow, the open-source way. In this talk I will do my best to illustrate a bit of that story.

            topoBIM: A 3D editor of topological data for early stage architectural design
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            The early stage of architectural design is characterized by limited information, rapid cycles of design development, and input from multiple stakeholders. This is a stage when proprietary computer aided design tools offer limited value: Building Information Modelling (or BIM), the industry standard software for creating and sharing 3D models with added building information, is seldom used in early design due to the cost and resource-intensiveness of the software and the high level of detail required to produce a workable model.

This presentation describes the development of topoBIM: a lightweight, web-based software for viewing 3D BIM models and adding topological connections between spaces. Topological connections that can be used to represent multiple types of building information including connectedness, adjacency, movement of people, and heating and cooling services. The talk will focus on the use of the topological data structure as a way to maintain the abstraction and simplicity required in the early stage of design while retaining a local understanding of spatial relationships. I will also discuss the use of web based technologies as a means of widening collaboration and participatory potential within the early stage design process.

           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            Much of the appreciation of artistic and design work focuses on the finished output. However, increasingly, the value in such work is encapsulated in the process that leads to the finished output and not the output itself. Artivity is a software tool that captures the creative process alongside the finished output. Unlike other documentation methods which require input from the artist or designer, Artivity runs in the background and it does not interfere with the creative process. Artivity collects data about the online resources artists use combined with data about the way they use creative software.
Artivity is useful for art and design historians who wish to interpret past work. It can help artists to self-archive their work. It can be used in teaching to explain and assess technique on creative software. Finally, Artivity data can help developers improve their creative software applications.
Following an overview of the project, in this presentation we will explain how Artivity works and the type of data that it produces. We will also show some examples of data produced by artists using Artivity as well as our plans for future development.

PhotoFlow supports most of the existing Bayer-based digital cameras, and provides a quite extended set of editing tools.
Very recently, the software's been adapted to serve as a GIMP 2.9 plug-in, allowing to open and process RAW files and send the image to GIMP in 32-bits floating point format.

I am going to talk about the challenges that I faced while writing a native client-side application, which is not GIMP, using GEGL; the fixes that were needed and gaps that need to be filled; and lessons learned. The corpus of code written using GEGL is limited, so there aren't that many examples to follow and learn from on the Internet. Hopefully, this talk will throw some light on the dark art of writing GEGL-based software.

In this context, the font source files benefit from a unified format called Unified Font Object which facilitates collaboration on typeface design. However, a lack of unification of documentation around those source files slows down innovation for new tools and applications. Some examples of such applications based or dependent on open source typography can be font viewers, CMS, classification tools, analytics and measuring applications, or private font databases.
Each time a font is created, modified or updated, the question of its documentation structure arises. This BOF meeting aims to frame this issue collectively, and be followed by a hackathon is to design this cross-usage structure as a common shared format.

           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an architectural design paradigm used to structure and communicate spatial (3D) building data. There is a need in early stage architectural design for bespoke software that allows designers to accomplish specific tasks and perform analyses based on data from the BIM model, without the limitations associated with proprietary BIM software.

In this workshop we will introduce challenges and invite discussion of solutions for the development of an open source BIM. Bespoke applications based on FLOSS software can extend access to data produced in proprietary BIM software to multiple stakeholders in the design process, and can be used to perform specific design tasks not provided by proprietary software. To introduce this topic we will present the example of topoBIM, a web-based application for viewing BIM models and editing topological data that can be used to capture multiple types of building information. This software was rapidly developed with limited resources using existing FLOSS applications and libraries for web-based building information model hosting (BIMServer) and visualization of BIM models based on WebGL (BIMSurfer).

Workshop description

We will prototype RESTful software installation. 
As starting point, we will use  my clj-fudi library and a handful of clojure middleware which will help us to pre-process data and connect Pd (vanilla) with on-line data provider. 
I will also provide you with a short introduction to Pure-data's data-structures and a subtractive sound synthesis.

Although we will be working with financial data (forex) using the concrete commercial API, you should find presented techniques useful with dealing with any sort of data. 

Keep track of this repository on github where I have been uploading most of material required to get started.

I will use gorilla-repl during the presentation. 
A worksheet for tutorial is available for viewing through gorilla online viewer to give you expression of what you could expect. 

To take  part in the workshop you will need a computer with fairly actual version of Pd vanilla (&gt; 0.45) as some patches use [array] object which is not available in Pd-extended distribution. You will also need Leiningen. In theory, operating system shouldn't matter but I work on Linux and my expertise is limited to it.
 
The workshop is based on code I wrote for my art work, so have a look at this description for some inspirations.

Disclaimer:
The level of workshop is quite advanced so expect very dense, funny and rough 2 hours.

            PIXLS.US – Building a Freedom Based Photography Community
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            Learning resources for photographers and visual artists using free software are often grouped according to the various projects.  Interactions take place in communities and mailing lists that are specific to those programs with only the occasional cross communication to other projects (and usually done by developers).  These communities tend to be focused less on the craft and more on the software itself.


As such there is a lack of learning resources approaching the overall practice of photography.  There are resources such as Phlearn, KelbyOne, and Lynda.com that look at various aspects of learning photography but they are a) focused on proprietary software mainly, and b) lock away the "good" content behind paywalls/subscriptions.  There are also workshops and seminars available but they suffer from the same problem as the previous resources (expensive, proprietary).

PIXLS.US is an attempt at rectifying this environment by approaching photography and learning with a similar outlook as free software.  The project aims to:

* Produce open, freely accessible learning materials for anyone to use and leverage without compromise in the quality and presentation.

* Foster a community for inclusion of everyone to discuss and learn all aspects of photography as well.

* Focus on photography first (craft-centric) followed closely with free-software use and its application to photography.

This presentation will look at the overview of building this community.  Including an overview of the material and people who have created and shared resources, the implementation of a modern forum (discourse) to support discussions, and some of the projects that have been created.  This presentation will also look at the overall results so far and where the community can hopefully go in the future to help continue promoting Free Software photographers and their work.

           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            This presentation will offer a short introduction and demonstration of Praxis LIVE, an open-source hybrid visual IDE for creative coding. Easily create projections, interactive spaces, custom VJ tools, media for theatre; use it as a live digital sketchbook, test out ideas, experiment with code.

Designed from the ground up for live media manipulation, Praxis LIVE includes an OpenGL video pipeline based on GStreamer and Processing. Patcher-style editing allows for fast project building - everything is editable live without interrupting your creative flow. Parameters can be controlled via custom GUIs, MIDI, OSC or using TinkerForge sensors.

Almost infinitely extendable, Praxis LIVE supports live-coding and can be extended at runtime. Fork components on-the-fly, or create new ones from scratch. The built-in code editor supports Processing / Java and GLSL. New components can be exported and shared, or can be imported from a growing library.

            Thanks to huge efforts from FLOSS projects since decades, publishing maps has become increasingly easy. Nonetheless, the amount of non-trivial knowledge necessary to setup cartographic projects has introduced a tendency from tool providers to whether reduce available features or to only let people overlay user defined graphics onto pre-existing maps. 
Wænd project aims to produce a tool to make maps, publish them online and share layers with other users of the platform. Contrary of many libre or non-libre map services, Wænd starts with a blank fully georeferenced canvas. So any added object (text, picture, media, or geographic shape) in put into spatial relationship with others. Another difference is, to be able to offer a large spectrum of tools before their integration in the GUI, the insisting presence of a console, which double as a learning tool. Layers and maps can be shared between users, mixing objective elements (like geographic shapes) and subjective ones touch the main stream of the platform, facilitating the re-appropriation of territorial representation and issues related to it. Wænd can double as framework for cartographic website publishing on the web.

Our aim is to create an open source workflow that makes hybrid publishing accessible to everyone! That’s why we created the Hybrid Publishing Toolkit. This toolkit helps content producers, designers, publishers and developers to work together to create print and digital publications simultaneously.

           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            A beginner's workshop to eTextiles (electronic textiles) and open source tools, participations will learn how to make simple touch based sensors which can be used with circuit boards to trigger outputs such as light or sound. We will focus on the tactile qualities of the materials we use, as opposed to the visual, which is normally the case with eTextiles.

To begin with we will learn to make very simple simple circuits using Arduino boards so that participants have a basic understanding about circuit making, physical computing and programming. We will then move onto simple crafting techniques such as sewing and felting to make our objects. These will then become part of our circuits, making them soft and tangible. Throughout this process we will discuss what it means to make computing more physical and tangible, and how this can lend itself to a more embodied experience of technology for the user.

            DECODING RANDOMNESS
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            The project poses fundamental questions concerning the working of human brain and randomness. Creativity and the search for original solutions, creative coding, building of new compositions, performances and prototypes, requires the extension of intellectual tools, including the replacement of simple generative techniques with probabilistic methods as well as with methods related with randomness. In order to deeply understand, develop and overcome algorithmic methods (including programs and devices), one needs to understand the notion of randomness and random generators.
The work analyses, among others, different probabilistic methods and pseudo-random generators, which are indispensable in numerous applications as well as in other domains (music, performance, computer games, safety on the network). These methods should be developed and applied through building new prototypical devices and programs. The project discusses new creative techniques and artistic strategies: creation of prototypes, open source, open hardware, hacking, tactical media etc. It is intended for experienced users interested in practical use of randomness for creative purposes in visual arts, music and performance. 
The project consists of: • practical application of pseudo­random generators for constructing music  and graphics with the use of languages such as LISP, Supercollider, Pure Data, Fluxus, etc. (automata, monte carlo method, random walk, pseudo­random generators, probability distributions and others) . • extraction of randomness from a physical processes through hacking analogue devices for detection, amplification, sonic and visual analysis (electromagnetic fields, gas particles, photons and decay of radioactive materials). • applications in building of new prototypes, arts and network security

            Metapolator began in March 2013. I took over as technical lead right after the LGM 2014 and started with its current incarnation in JavaScript. This involved creating new technology which is now represented in the Atem project. For the first time Metapolator is in a minimal state where it is actually useful to support the font making process. Atem exposes the technology used in Metapolator to be more visible, approachable and easy to use—also outside of the scope of Metapolator.
In this meeting I will start briefly with an introduction into the current state of Metapolator and its vision for font design. From there we will go on a trip to Atem. This will take us deeply into the technology and concepts behind Metapolator and inspire new applications of Atem. I expect and welcome audience interaction and will prepare a list of challenges the project faces for further discussion. I will display demos.

            SpreadFlow – Metadata extraction and processing engine
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            SpreadFlow is a metadata extraction and processing engine. Its main purpose is to support file based media production workflows by observing changes to text and media files in real-time. Information gathered through this process can be used to transform and recombine content, e.g., in order to prepare it for different publishing channels. Since processing is triggered immediately after files are modified, it also can be used to validate content and provide timely feedback to editors and DTP operators.

In order to encourage reuse of (prebuilt) components, the software design follows the dataflow programming paradigm. As a result, a media production workflow can be expressed as a directed graph where vertices represent operations and edges the flow of data/metadata. This architecture permits that workflows could be built and modified using a graphical editor such as NoFlo UI in the future.

The software is currently being used in production at the Swiss weekly newspaper "WOZ". The prepress environment is based on proprietary OS and DTP software. SpreadFlow is free (and based on free software), hence adapting a workflow to a different environment is as easy as swapping out the product-specific components.

            after.video video book
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            This paper presents the After.Video video book, discussing the topic of “Online and offline
platforms for the exhibition and circulation of audiovisual media”. The After.Video book represents a fusion of the modes of the digital/networked publication and the traditional form of the physical book. There have been first thoughts about the links and exchanges of the old traditional format of the book and the possible accordances of the digital book on a more practical level. The theoretical framing is given by thinkers of the book like Bob Stein:
“the computer screen became a place for synchronous and asynchronous conversation. As web technology improved people started putting essays and books in a browser with a dynamic margin where readers could make comments visible to everyone. Over the past ten years the experience of dozens of 'social reading' platforms suggests that books will become places where people congregate to hash out thoughts and ideas.” (1) Practically this fusion of the possibilities and formats of new digital media (like video) and traditional academic text-form is also making headways – like exemplified in the 'Frames of Mind'-project (2). Open Humanities Press has taken these beginnings and fused different pre-existing trajectories of development as instantiated by above projects and conceptions, and fused them with the idea of rendering the digital book After.Video as a physical device, much along the lines already taken in the landmark project “The Weise7 in/compatible Laboratorium Archive” (3). This conceptual leap represented by the dual-mode video-book enables the Centre for Digital Cultures (4) and Open Humanities Press (5) to not only go beyond the format offered by the first two volumes of Video Vortex (as put out by the Institute for Network Cultures6), but also beyond the current state of digital publishing in media-rich, video-centric contexts, thus presenting a unique
publication which reflects upon video theoretically, but attempts to fuse form and content in its own dual format.

- Great homework assignments and other exciting results
- Economic conditions for teachers and students

The folklore of teaching is what, as Golan Levin coined it, the part of it that's not been recorded, that's not being pushed to a Github repo.

The idea of this meeting would be to share and collect the folklore of teaching FLOSS. What are the good and bad experiences (or anecdotes), educators have encountered while teaching FLOSS.

            Future of OpenRaster
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            OpenRaster (.ora) is an open format for two-dimensional layered bitmap graphics. It steals ideas liberally from the ODF and SVG formats, and provides a way of bridging the divide between applications which need to exchange basic layer data. OpenRaster is supported by many art programs for data interchange, including Krita, GIMP, and Scribus, and it is the primary file format used by MyPaint. It was proposed as a response to additional restrictions placed by Adobe on their formerly open PSD file format in 2006, at the very first Libre Graphics Meeting, by Boudewijn Rempt and Cyrille Berger, and has subsequently grown into a useful file format in its own right.

This session will discuss the future course of OpenRaster as a format. In no particular order, we'll be trying to establish a plan for:

* Nailing down a useful, basic text layer format.
* Basic animation support.
* Layer fallbacks.
* A nice logo for the project ☺
* Moving the spec to a git(hub?) repository, and establishing formal versioned releases.
* Establishing a good review workflow for the specification.
* Maintaining a reference implementation.
* Creating a library of test images for testing.

            Teaching Design Livre in the Global South – Showcase on courses and student artwork from Brazil
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            A new course called Digital Design came to life in a countryside Brazilian university. Like many others before it, the course had to be innovative and socially engaged. With Design Livre, the use of Inkscape, Gimp and other FOSS, students were empowered to produce their work in a free and collaborative model. Teachers from other universities contributed in online talks and onsite guidance. In this presentation, this story is retold, works are showcased and other teachers feedback is gathered. Entrepreneurship, academic research and other areas of education towards Libre Graphics are part of the design world in the Global South. In order to achieve sustainable development countries bet on new philosophies of production and innovative ways of thinking about professional education. In this meeting we plan to hear more solutions and present views from teachers and students.

            Case Study: EdLab MMU: Using Libre Graphics Tools and Assets in an Education Lab setting.

           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            EdLab MMU is a conceptual workshop space created to align innovative practice and community engagement in the context of informal education. EdLab has embraced many open practices including the use of Libre Graphics toolsets and openly licenced assets for the creation of OER and materials for participatory workshops. This presentation is a whistle stop tour of our work in this area and an invitation to collaborate on further initiatives.  

In partnership with FLOSS Manuals, the emerging EdLab project has been exploring and implementing a design approach to the digital representation of concepts and workshopped activities. Outputs and processes are shared with students via the open publishing of designed material. A hands-on approach has been taken with practical workshops on creating resources with FLOSS design and publishing tool chains.

            Report of the “Objects in Common” worksession
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            From 7–12/03 Constant vzw and Medialab Prado are organizing a worksession in Madrid. My proposal is to make a report about this session. 

Objects in common are everyday objects, but they are also shared objects, objects that create a community and objects that are a confluence of many skill sets and practices. They are, therefore, objects that shape and transform our common experience. 
    * How is it possible to make the manufacture and design of these objects really accessible, beyond the mere publication of online plans and platforms?
    * How do we connect the diversity of everyday contexts, from the professional tools we use on a daily basis to our domestic items?        
    * How do we create objects collectively that are flexible in their use and are made by and for other bodies, geopolitical contexts?
    * How do we reconcile distributed manufacturing with the relatively sustainable use of natural resources?

Consider the life of a "free" Object in Common, from concept to digital file, to a physical object to remix or deconstruct. 
This is a meeting with all kinds of international makers, mostly linked to physical spaces (fablabs, hackerspaces and other) that have a specific methodology, context and/or space.

            Introducing an OpenHardware Spectrograph: ColorHug+
           </p>
           <div class="item-description js-hidden hidden">
            The original ColorHug colorimeter device was designed in 2011, and then in 2014 we released an upgrade called ColorHug2. We've sold over 3 thousand OpenHardware devices to artists, photographers and animators who care passionately about free hardware. Whilst ColorHug and ColorHug2 colorimeters have calibrated many monitors over the years, they could not not measure ink color or surface patches which limited the free software color calibration workflow drastically.

ColorHug+ is a new project that aims to solve this problem for people that care about free hardware. The device is a linear spectrograph and has sufficient resolution to build ICC color profiles for scanners, printers and displays. Spot measurements can be taken, and due to a switched UV illuminant, paper white can be accurately calculated for an accurate print preview.

I've spent the last 2 years on-and-off working on this device, and now have several prototypes. In the presentation I will talk about the journey and the perils of OpenHardware, and what I think the future holds. I'll include lots of photos and not so many words.  I'll also allow time at the end for questions and also bring some hardware for people to play with.
