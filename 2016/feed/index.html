<p>Richard Hughes returns with his latest update on the ColorHug series of devices for determining spectrographic data on displays. The latest version, ColorHug+ isn&#8217;t quite available, though will be soon. This adds the ability to not only check displays for accuracy of color representation, but also printed material and the paper that is used, since it contains some LEDs for illumination of the material. So now you can add the ability to determine ICC profiles for your printers and the papers you use.</p>

<p>Wendy had become ill, so Julien gave her presentation about this project, Objetos Communes, carried out at MediaLab Prado, which sought to investigate and disseminate the knowledge and skills involved with making a variety of common objects, using open source technologies where possible, in a effort of demystify these processes and ways of thinking about creation in a collaborative environment. In addition, there was time spent on documenting what had taken place.</p>

<p>Renata comes from the city of Quixadá in Brazil, where an increasingly recognized university has arisen in what was formerly rural Brazil. Her efforts which she highlights in this presentation involve a project to increase the involvement of the community, both students and nonstudents, in learning about technology, and learning how to design and create collaboratively various objects and processes using advanced technologies. To a large extent this involves open source solutions.</p>

<p>Paula and Lisa have been involved with the creation and evolution of a series of projects at the community level, to increase the awareness and reduce the resistance to the use of open source software in collaborative environments. So far they have largely focused on increasing the gender diversity of involvement. What they wish to do is to spread the impact of what they have learned from this process and share with others.</p>

<p>Femke announced that the group who has assiduously been behind the production of Libre Graphics Magazine has ceased its operation, and tentatively at least, LGM the magazine is no more. She thus presents a challenge to see if LGM the organization can come up with a way of continuing the magazine or some new production, using FOSS and available digitally and in print. She drew a line in the sand, hoping that by LGM 2017 there might have been a consensus to proceed in some direction.</p>
