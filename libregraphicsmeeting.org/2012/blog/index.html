						<p>Help us preparing the LGM final report we will need for all our<br />
communications with sponsoring organizations, whether they are<br />
corporate, non-profit or public.</p>
<p>From each team present at LGM 2012 we need a short text telling in a<br />
lively manner, including a good quote to summarize, what was<br />
accomplished at LGM this year and how important LGM is in the<br />
development cycle of your project. Get to the point. It doesn’t have<br />
to be long. It only has to say the important things!</p>
<p>To the <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2012/project-feedback/" title="Project Feedback">Project Feedback form &raquo;</a></p>
<p>Of course, your very welcome to publish the summary also in your Blog<br />

<p>We would also encourage you to fill our participant feedback form:</p>
<p>To the <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2012/participant-feedback/" title="Participant Feedback">Participant Feedback form  &raquo;</a></p>
<p>Each person having participated is invited to give feedback and help<br />
us improve the LGM!<br />
(well, if somebody wants to write the reasons why he or she<br />
didn&#8217;t travel to Vienna, his / her feedback is also very welcome!)</p>
<p>No field is mandatory: just fill the ones that matter to you.</p>
<p>Thanks again for participating at the LGM 2012!</p>

						<p>The LGM 2012 is over. After one week of hard working the LGMers are traveling home with lot of new ideas which will keep them busy for the next months. (If you find one wandering around in the <a href="http://metalab.at">Metalab</a>, please send him/her home!)<br />
In the next days we will publish a report with more details about what happened in Vienna: stay tuned!<br />
Just one more thing for tonight: the 50+ people who you see in the group picture and who were at the final talk, decided by acclamation to put the next LGM in the hands of Marcos and Femke: see you next year in Madrid!</p>

						<h1><a href="../2012/04/press-release-2-lgm-begins-in-a-few-days/index.html">Press release #2 &#8211; LGM begins in a few days&#8230;</a></h1>

						<p>There are only a few days until the 7th edition of LGM begins. We can proudly announce the talks schedule at this time.</p>
<p>As it does every year, the Libre Graphics Meeting focuses on individual and group interaction with an emphasis towards free media and the free software that produces it. This year, the program for Libre Graphics Meeting contains a lot of talks about new developments in the world of free graphics and design software. The schedule for the talks contains more then 40 talks.</p>
<p>The talks are not the only points in the program of Libre Graphics Meeting. Every day there are hacking sessions, meetings, and workshops planned as well. LGM’s strength comes from the presenters who talk about their work and inspire others by sharing their experiences, techniques, and best practices.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the program, you can find it <a href="../program/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The 7th edition of the Libre Graphics Meeting will help bring the development of free graphic software forward in LGM tradition. Whether you are a developer, an artist, or an enthusiast, you can be a part of this year’s event. If you decide to visit the 7th Libre Graphics Meeting, you can register <a href="../registration/index.html">here</a>. There is no entrance fee and it&#8217;s not too late to participate with an Lightning Talk or a BoF-session.</p>
<p>The Libre Graphics Meeting needs still the support with the travelling costs for speakers, however. There is a <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16614">Pledgie campaign</a> for gathering the money that we still need. So if you are a user of tools like Scribus, GIMP, Inkscape, or any of the many other projects that are participating in LGM, making a pledge is a great way to say &#8216;Thank You&#8217; to the developers of the tools you use.</p>

						<p>We&#8217;ve got lot wonderful submissions: now, we are busy sorting out the last details and preparing the program for the four days of the LGM.</p>
<p>For the ones who were not aware of the submission deadline: we are not accepting 30 minutes talks anymore (except if you have a very very good talk and very very very good reasons for not having it submitted before!) but we&#8217;d like  leave free spaces for spontaneous  work sessions, workshops, BOFs, demos, short and lightning talks! Feel free to submit your proposal by using the yellow button in the upper right corner!</p>
<p>Most of all: we would like to have a short (5 or 10 minutes) presentation about each of the projects at the LGM!</p>

						<h1><a href="../2012/02/last-call-for-talk-submissions/index.html">Last call for talk submissions</a></h1>

						<div id="magicdomid750">Two days are left for submitting talks, workshops, and panels for the upcoming Libre Graphics Meeting!</div>
<div id="magicdomid249"></div>
<div id="magicdomid661">Please consider that the audience we expect in Vienna is mostly people who are already part of one of our projects or graphic artists who already know our products. For this reason, we will favor talks about topics that are interesting for people who are active in our projects or who want to spread technologies, ideas, or code to other projects.</div>
<div id="magicdomid619"></div>
<div id="magicdomid723">We still would love to provide publicity for your project, but we think the best way to do that is via short talks and lightning talks. If you have more to say than what fits in those formats, you&#8217;re welcome to submit more than one &#8220;shorter&#8221; talk to cover different aspects of your project. It&#8217;s our goal to have at least one short talk (about 10 minutes) or lightning talk (5 minutes) for each project represented at LGM. You&#8217;re also welcome to submit proposals for workshops, where you will give an introduction to your software or teach specific advanced skills.</div>
<div id="magicdomid256"></div>
<div id="magicdomid725">We also ask you to use the <a href="../submit-a-talk/index.html">same submission</a> form to announce BOFs, work session, and  project meetings. Please, announce them as soon as you start planning them, so that we can make sure that we have enough rooms for all of them!</div>
<div id="magicdomid727"></div>
<div id="magicdomid740">If you&#8217;re interested in having a booth where you can sell products related to your project or demo your project, please fill the <a href="../submit-a-talk/index.html">submission form</a> as well. We can&#8217;t give you any guarantee that we will able to provide a booth, but we will try to!</div>
<div id="magicdomid262"></div>
<div id="magicdomid650">Some final remarks:</div>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> 1st March deadline</strong> is most important for full talks. For all other proposals, we will be much more flexible, as long as we can accomodate them!</li>
<li>If you need a visa, please get in touch with us in a timely manner!</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget to <a href="../registration/index.html">register</a> as soon as you know that you wil be coming.</li>
