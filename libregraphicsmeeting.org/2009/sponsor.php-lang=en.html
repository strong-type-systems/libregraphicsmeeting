<p>Last year, we raised over $12,000 in community donations for the Libre Graphics Meeting. This year, we are again running <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/2926">a fundraising campaign</a> to allow us to cover the costs of the conference.</p>
<p>Especially this year, with sponsorship budgets being cut across the board, your support is essential to allow us to put on the conference, and ensure that we have a critical mass of involved developers present.  The vast majority of our budget is spent subsidising the travel of the developers who create software such as GIMP, Scribus, Inkscape and other free software creative projects.</p>
