Beyond that, it's a world of ethical and code difference.
</li><li>algo así
</li><li>Look deeper.
</li><li>It's so much better AFTER you config and install zillions of plugins.
</li><li>I love different tools for similar tasks.
</li><li>The Nexus 4 is just like a iPhone, isn't it? Same thing (a smartphone) to do the same thing (make calls, send messages, run apps), but working in a different way. GIMP is not (and has never tried to be) a drop-in replacement for Photoshop, which is why some of the people who have invested (in time, money and experience) in Photoshop struggle to get to grips with it. And yes, Photoshop can do some things that GIMP can't, but if people are taught skills, rather than trained in the use of a particular piece of software, then their knowledge is more transferrable, and as these missing features are added and matured, people gain a very valuable thing indeed: choice.
</li><li>You can accomplish a lot of the same tasks but it's different in some ways.
</li><li>In general yes, but GIMP is maintained by a community of voluntaries and not owned by a company.
</li><li>Photoshop is commercial software and GIMP is Free Software, that means the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

In the short term they can even be the better solution. However you're dependant on one company to develop the tools you're using. This can work ok but you don't have much influence over the direction those tools go. Also you are helpless if the company goes bankrupt, is bought by another company or simply discontinues the product (or service).
</li><li>If crimes are so bad, why do people keep committing them?
</li><li>Because they learned to use those programs in art school, because art school chose to teach those programs, because companies ask for them in the job market, because companies think these programs are taught in art schools, and the cycle repeats. 
</li><li>IT IS CALLED VENDOR LOCK-IN!
</li><li>That's individual for every user of the particular software. I'm using free software to get my work done faster.
</li><li>Hi! I do like propietary SW, however open source SW usually is more helpful, in the long term talking. 
</li><li>If cars do harm to the environment, why are people still using them?
</li><li>Proprietary programs are not bad, they are restrictive about your freedom: if you want more freedom about your artwork, you should use free softwares. Most people don't know any alternative, and some people despise free software because they aren't commercial. So most people still use them... help us spread the world about libre graphics!

</li><li>Would you take the money if you didn't need it? You refuse the pay, not because you don't need it, but to stop your mind from thinking the thoughts of a slave.
</li><li>If you could be paid for the SAME work then get paid! If not, some prefer to do the work they want instead of doing the work someone asked them to do.
</li><li>Because you love it!
</li><li>Why do people paint in their spare time? Why do people make music in their spare time? Why do people read, and write fiction in their spare time? Because it's something that interests them, it's something they *love*, and it's the very act of creation that provides its own reward.
</li><li>You can be paid to write free software too! And you can do things for other purposes than money...

</li><li>If you're doing design in the 21st century, you sure as heck are going to be concerning yourself with technlogy.
</li><li>Software is not just a way to get a job done but constitutes a big part of your creative practice. This deserves your attention!
</li><li>You do both.
</li><li>Is it really possible to have a clear separation?
</li><li>It's all well and good being interested in something, but if you're going to take it seriously then you've got to at least entertain some of the things that lie on the peripheries of that thing.
</li><li>It's not only about technology and design, it's also about freedom.

</li><li>WTF?!
</li><li>What is FLOSS great for?
</li><li>In the same sense as proprietary software is, really.
</li><li>If you don't experiment, your work won't evolve. If it is closed, you cannot change how you produce work. Your mileage will vary.
</li><li>I need experimentation at work
</li><li>Yes, it's like love.
</li><li>Sometimes FLOSS is faster, sometimes it's not. It is easier to automate and modify to fit your workflow.
</li><li>Those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity. 
</li><li>Time ripens all things; no man is born wise.
</li><li>This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it. 
</li><li>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. 
</li><li>The privilege of feeling at home everywhere belongs only to kings, wolves and robbers.

Suppose there are two friends, B and C, taking a road trip, and they both decided to bring along a friend of their own; B brought his friend A and C brought his friend D. A knows B, but has never met C and D before and they may well never meet again, and similarly D has never met A and B.
