The bids for the next-next year are expected within 6 months after the last day of each LGM.

People who would want to organise LGM on 2011 would have stepped in at that time and the 2-year process could start.<\/p>\n<h2>Aiming at a Consensus<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In no way this whole process is meant to split the LGMers appart on a Venue. What we aim at is a consensus.<\/li>\n<li>If there are two or more bids on the table that are equivalently solid from the organizational stand point, we can try to sort this out by asking both teams if one accepts to go for the year after.<\/li>\n<li>In this case, we should make it clear that the venue is secured also for the year after. I suggest that if this is the case it\u2019s good news because we could start the local sponsorship campaign ahead of time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>A Particular Case in 2010 &#8211;Louis<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the process described above, we should have announced the venue for 2011 at the end of LGM 2010.<\/li>\n<li>We would know within the next 6 months who is going to bid for 2012.<\/li>\n<li>This was not the case and we now have a bid from Vietnam and one from Montreal and a quick and important decision to make on July 1st, 2010.<\/li>\n<li>It is clear that at this point in time lots of eyes a turned towards Vietnam but we haven\u2019t decided so, yet. There are many questions which need to be discussed and answered before we have a go, no matter how interesting is the bid \u2014 and it\u2019s a very interesting bid!<\/li>\n<li>We want to come up with a consensus and so by no means what I write here should be understood as my personnal choice towards the city I live in!<\/li>\n<li>At LGM 2010 we learned that Vietnam and Brazil both wanted to propose a bid. And I mentionned again, unsurprinsingly to most of the attenders, that Montreal was of course always ready to host the LGM. In my view, provided we agree on the proposed two-year process, the new bids would have been for&#8230; 2012. I don\u2019t mean that the discussion is over for 2011. I only mean that this could be the case. In this case, we would fall back on Montreal for 2011 with a proven organisation. This is only hypothetical, again.<\/li>\n<li>Let\u2019s say we\u2019re engaged into that process only for the sake of this discussion. Both bidders have 6 months to prepare their bid and start preparing the ground and the process goes on as described above.<\/li>\n<li>This process is in my view very sane as it evacuates the emotional charge and the last-minute decision making.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two-year Process Establishing Next Venue No surprise.
