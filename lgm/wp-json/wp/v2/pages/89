Wow!<\/i><\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>As the LGM grows, needs are getting bigger. We now think of a 2-year process to determine where LGM venue will be since we have bids from all over the world indluding Asia and South America. Also, there are more people getting involved than the first few teams. We have an increasing number of projects participating every year.<\/i><\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>This puts pressure on the organisers (good pressure, let\u2019s be clear!), pressure on the budget and in many aspects the needs are growing. We thought we need to address this in the most efficient manner. While I agree that at some point we might or we will need a formal organisation, before this is association will be up and running we might as well get organised nonetheless and here is a beginning. This proposal does not defeat the idea of a formal association.I think we can work &#8220;informally&#8221; in a quite organised manner.

Some of them are already put down below. Some more may come as this discussion go further. The people on the board are not expected to work alone but they have the responsibility to make sure the job gets done.<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"Make_the_choice_of_the_next_LGMs_local_team_and_venue_a_two-year_process.\" name=\"Make_the_choice_of_the_next_LGMs_local_team_and_venue_a_two-year_process.\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Make the choice of the next LGMs local team and venue a two-year process.<\/h4>\n<p>This is becoming urgent because of the growing complexity of the LGM. It should allow to better plan ahead with the growing needs, the budget, securing the sponsors, preparing documents, preparing the venue and help local organisers get things done in the best possible manner. Especially when people are organising LGM for a first time. And especially now that we have views on going as far as Asia, South America and on the mid or long term even Africa (yes, we already have some ideas for this on the back burner, especially now that we have the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie as a sponsor and even as a partner we could say).<\/p>\n<p><a id=\"Secure_the_budget_6_months_prior_to_the_event.\" name=\"Secure_the_budget_6_months_prior_to_the_event.\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Secure the budget 6 months prior to the event.<\/h4>\n<p>This goal may sound a bit difficult to reach for some of us who have been involved into the process of getting the money in. Here is why we think this should be done without further delay.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>More people are travelling to LGM. Every year we have to struggle with the budget, not knowing in advance what height it will be.<\/li>\n<li>Are we going to be able to reimburse 100% of the travel expenses of the developers and the speakers?<\/li>\n<li>Will there be enough money to cover the basic costs?<\/li>\n<li>Etc.<\/li>\n<li>The LGM needs to be ready to commit itself up front and say to someone who plans to come, yes we can pay for your plane, plan ahead.<\/li>\n<li>The money doesn\u2019t need to be in the bank, it needs to be secured by the simple mean of a written agreement, an exchange of emails, and an invoice sent from the GNOME Foundation to the sponsor.<\/li>\n<li>The process has to start as early as the days after LGM ends.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>(On the long-term we can envision that the LGM organisation weill be able to pay a per-diem subsidy for food and accomodation, letting people adding more to it if they want to but at least giving the opportunity to people who can\u2019t affort it otherwise to get to LGM. Historically we have not paid for food and accomodation. We have paid for the flight, the train, the bus, the fuel. We could envision to ease the financial pressure on the volunteers who work hard and on spare time when they attend and participate to LGM.)<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a id=\"Creation_of_an_LGM_board\" name=\"Creation_of_an_LGM_board\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h1>Creation of an LGM board<\/h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The board works in close relationship with the LGM teams and with the community.<\/li>\n<li>The board aims at decisions based on consensus<\/li>\n<li>The board has to come up with recommendations and guidelines about the venue<\/li>\n<li>Is responsible in the end for putting together the LGM each year.<\/li>\n<li>Is responsible for the budget and reimbursement of participants\u2019 trip expenses<\/li>\n<li>There are 9 members of the board.

The people who have received this email are my first pick. This does not mean we cannot enlarge the circle, of course. If someone doesn\u2019t want to be on the board, just mention it.

(This is to prevent that a local organiser ends up with the burden of responsibility for accepting\/refusing talks. We expect more talks to be proposed for LGM 2011, especially once the reimbursement process becomes more transparent.)<\/li>\n<li>Take action to diversify participation, both in speakers and in participants. We obviously cannot force anything, but it definetely helps to pay attention. LGM 2006-2009 had *in total* 7 female speakers. LGM 2010 had 9.

Again not easy (although with reimbursement decided before the event, it has become a lot easier) and not clear how this could work.
