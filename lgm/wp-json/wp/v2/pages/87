Do we need to care about those issues &#8220;as an organisation&#8221; and to what extent? The answer to these questions are sometimes complex and I think that from the LGM stand point, they belong to the individual field. Some people are never going to go to the US because of patents issues and possible judiciary threat. This is serious. This is not a theoretical issue. It\u2019s real world. I think we &#8220;as an organisation&#8221; cannot make those calls on behalf of someone else. At some point it is up to each individual to decide whether he or she would want to go or not to a specific country.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;As an organisation&#8221; we need to pass the following test:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>to consider how many individuals would make such a dramatic decision as to refuse to go to a country for ethical or political issues and<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>evaluate to what extent would that in itself be a blocking issue to the organisation for the event.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>This is not an automatic call. We need to gather the information from the people and from the teams.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Security<\/h2>\n<p>It is implied that we would not organise an LGM in a country where the security of people would be at risk. Risk being understood as a real threat (war, epidemic, natural disaster). Otherwise, it is up to each individuals to decide whether they come or not.<\/p>\n<p><em>Given the case, the same test apply as in [1.]<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Health<\/h2>\n<p>We need to gather the relevant information about possible health hazards when travelling to any country. It is up to each individuals to decide whether they are ready to cope with various health issues while going to LGM for a few days. Yellow fever, typhoid, paludism, cholera, most of tropical or subtropical illnesses are serious issues for travellers. People have to know. As organisers, we have to find out how many people feel comfortable with being vaccined and\/or under pills treatment for such health hazards.<\/p>\n<p><em>Given the case, the same test apply as in [1.]<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>list of vaccines that travelers must have<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Free Software Acceptance or Support in the Host Country<\/h2>\n<p>The question has been raised and I think we have to answer. As a possible answer, I think this is not relevant per se to isolate countries based on how they accept or refuse Free Software. France and Germany are well-known to have a strong political support for FLOSS and we have never been to Germany and once only to France. Canada\u2019s record with regards to FLOSS is rather deceptive. And we\u2019re not sure about Poland. From that point of view, countries like Brazil have embraced FLOSS at the state level and they are making this a strong commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Really, again, beside the judiciary threat to developers, I would advise not to consider this an argument against a country because it defeats the purpose of having such an event like LGM on the first place.<\/p>\n<p>To summarize: Not an issue and perhaps even an argument in favour of going and celebrating free software and showing its goodness&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Money<\/h2>\n<p>Budget is a critical issue and certainly the most blocking issue if not solved adequately. We definitely need to put down the numbers.<\/p>\n<h3>Expense<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What does it cost to travel to the proposed venue?<\/li>\n<li>What are the costs related to other expenses?<\/li>\n<li>Administrative costs<\/li>\n<li>Unexpected extra costs (or losses)<\/li>\n<li>Balance for the next year (could be zero, but it\u2019s time we think of having money in the bank)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Income<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Corporate sponsoring<\/li>\n<li>Local sponsoring<\/li>\n<li>Institutional sponsoring<\/li>\n<li>Community Pledgie Campaign<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As the LGM organisation reimburses the travel expenses of the developers and speakers, this question has to be answered to the complete satisfaction of the organisation.<\/p>\n<p>The budget varies a lot from year to year but we struggle all the time very hard to gather all this money. It is NOT easy, no matter the strength of the will we have to organise the LGM to any place in the world. On the debriefing of LGM 5, we have discussed about securing the budget 6 months prior to the event in order to be able to make commitments to the sponsored participants before they buy their ticket. I think this is a perfect goal for the 6th year of LGM and from then on. We need to get this mechanism to work.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be great to see participants who wish to organise a LGM be part of the organising team for at least a year prior to organise one themselves.<\/li>\n<li>Short list of potential local and foreign sponsors with someone listed as contact, which in this case could make easier the international group to make a follow up of sponsorship status.<\/li>\n<li>Small list with items that usually need to get paid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Time<\/h3>\n<p>How long is the trip for the developers ? This needs to be considered. Since LGM 3 we have a 4-days conference. The LGM takes time. When in Europe or in North America, for most of the developers it\u2019s a one-week trip, sometimes even less. Lots of LGM project\u2019s developers live in Europe and a fair bunch lives in the Americas. Going anywhere else puts pressure on the total length of the trip for the majority of developers.<\/p>\n<p>By no mean this is to be understood as a &#8220;no go&#8221; to Asia, India, South America or Africa. But we need to keep an eye on the time frame and on how individuals are going to react once they realise that an LGM in those parts of the world is at least a 2-week time off their regular day-to-day work. This can be planned ahead and may be a good occasion to organise a longer trip, if one can afford it. But we need to be realistic. It\u2019s a real question that needs a real answer.<\/p>\n<p><em>Given the case, the same test apply as in [1.]<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colliding events with estimated dates where LGM would be done.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The LGM Projects\u2019 teams<\/h2>\n<p>What do LGM Teams think of the venue is also crucial for the organisation. If a team decides not to come to a certain venue, it can also defeat the purpose and goals of LGM.

Considering that our virtual communities are global but our physical locations can be mainly identified with one or two regions (&#8220;Center-North Europe&#8221; or &#8220;Center-North Europe &amp; North America&#8221;) and considering the fact that most people don&#8217;t seem to wish to travel too much around the world, I&#8217;d like to propose one of two models:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em> a three year alternation between Europe, North America and the rest of the world<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em> a two year alternation between Europe and the rest of the world<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em> My point point of view may be very europe-centric, so, please, do comment on this!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Femke 15:28, 23 June 2010 (UTC) model three (alternation between continents):<\/strong> <em>LGM is a truly international event.

Better to stick to the core issues of what makes a site a good\/adequate location for the meeting. The only other consideration is that there should hopefully be some way to be sure that the meeting is not so inconvenient for the majority leading to poor attendance. I don&#8217;t think it makes sense to have an LGM without a good percentage of project team members in attendance.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethical\/Political Issues Is it advisable to draw the line about political or ethical issues?
