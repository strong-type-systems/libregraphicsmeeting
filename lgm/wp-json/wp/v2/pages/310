After being told this, the volunteer continued to make threatening statements about the participant and also to other members of the community.<\/p>\n<p>The gravity of these incidents and the impact they have on the safety and well-being of other volunteers and event participants needs to be addressed. Though the LGM community and event do not currently have an explicit code of conduct in place, physical violence and threats of planned harm cannot and will not be tolerated.<br \/>\nWe have been notified that the volunteer in question continues to engage in harassing behaviour, and have thus decided to draw a line.<\/p>\n<p>We have notified the aggressor that we do not want their participation in future Libre Graphics Meetings and the related communication channels.<\/p>\n<p>We regret having to take this action due to the help given by this volunteer  at LGM.
