The team will meet within the next few weeks and deliver a year-round communications plan.
Possibly plan monthly (ish?) meetings to consider opportunities to publicize LG to a wider audience.
The communications team will consider ways to improve outreach to software projects.
Define a "Mission Statement" or "Vision Statement" for the meeting. (per Julien).


"Branding" (design? please?)
Should this actually be the responsibility of the local organisation? A difference between global and a local branding? Consistency and the price of it?

On-line infrastructure

 * Ale
 * Manuel
 * (lara removed student participants after the meeting and reconsidering their involvement)

LGM-single-sentence-Manifestos
LGM is  a congregation of artists, developers and enthusiasts for graphics, video, design and publishing free software, engaged in sharing ideas, work and teaching. 

LGM is about tools to create Libre culture. (Ale Gonzãlez)

an understanding that the tools we use, shape the artistic work we create

A meeting of people involved with developing & using libre graphics to do professional quality work, with a focus on showing what can be done and on building what can't.

LGM is the meeting where you find representants of all FLOSS related with arts.

A tribe of diverse voices and interests gathering around talks, workshops and empowering activities related to visual, graphics, processes and tools all published under open licenses.


Libre Graphics Meeting provides an opportunity for artists, designers, and engineers to exchange ideas and to demonstrate products so as to make each more capable of building, creating, and communicating.

LGM is the annual, in-person gathering of users and developers of the free-software graphics community, where the people involved exchange ideas, collaborate, and share what their work for the ultimate enrichment of the community as a whole. (Nate Willis)

LG(M) is a meeting place - of people and projects; online through the year and physically manifest somewhere on the planet once a year. Where directions and voice operators, dreamers and crafters of cultural; visual digital media technologies converge or collide.

an annual release of a year's pent-up joy, excitement and agony which those who don't use F/LOSS could never understand :)

An occasion to expermiment with possible connections between creative  users, creative developers and creative activists caring about Free, libre and open source software.

The Libre Graphics Meeting is a gathering of people from the software and art spectrum. It fosters communication and the exchange of ideas with a strong focus on free software tools. (Simon)

intersections in free software. an extensible meeting of many perspectives - in, on and around - the implementation, culture and practice of FLOSS

The one time in the year when programmers, developers and users of for free and open source software for graphics are leaving their virtual communities and make huge progresses. (ale)

A place to meet and hangout with the people who are involved with/ make, cool tools that I use,  and complain about all the things I want to get fixed.

LGM is a collection of artists, designers, and developers coming together based on principles of Free Software (and (Open) Culture) to share their work and experiences with each other and the public. (patdavid)
