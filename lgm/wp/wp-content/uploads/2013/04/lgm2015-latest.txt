AGENDA

Learning from 2014
- short report by Sirko
@ Create clear job descriptions for each team. Allow members to be more indepent, based on job descriptions
@ It was not clear how many people would join: gambling on catering, size of social event
To do: figure out a system of making the system more obliging? payment online ?

suggestions: 
- ask a very small entry fee (10 euro / dollar ), an investment engages people to come. 
goal would not be to earn money, but to have a system that lowers unregistered / faulty registrations
- improve communication of informal donations for lunch. it was there but not clear for all ..

concerns: is open for all policy not damaged ?
- lower the error margin by countng the registrations in time (two weeks ahead)

- We should review the forms (co-speakers mentioned in comment box)
- Dietary restrictions are an issue: can we collect information beforehand to make sure food needs are taken care of?
- Infrastructure needs: how can we make sure the registration system lets us do everything we need?
- Current registration system is brittle. Needs to be more robust.
- Asking designers to improve the website's usability
- Food is important! Having food on site makes it easier to keep people in the building.
- People can be cost-averse: Making clear what participants will get for their money, if there is money involved, is important

Teams and description of tasks

notes: 
@ Too strict division between teams and tasks can be counter-productive
@ Teams were headless, responsibilities are not always clear - per team a contact person is needed who is informed about the teams' work
@ Too many mailinglists ... 
@ delay of respsonse
@ cross team communication: regular irc meetings can help diminish the mountain of mails .. get a meetbot (https://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot) to record meetings and distribute minutes
@ having clearer agendas for meetings and expectations before meetings start
