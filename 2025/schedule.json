                "abstract": "Processing is one of the most widely used open-source tools for creative coding and CS education. Since it was first released in 2001, it has been instrumental in teaching coding to students, artists, and designers worldwide, serving as a gateway into programming for people who might never have touched code otherwise.\n\nA remarkable thing about Processing is the consistency of its API. Most Processing code written twenty years ago still runs in Processing today with only minor changes. That kind of longevity is rare in software and speaks to the project's thoughtful design.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the project has been struggling.\n\nFor a long time, Processing relied on a small, dedicated core team. As contributors moved on, fewer people remained who understood the full complexity of the codebase. Maintenance became harder. Key libraries stopped working. By the time Processing 4 was released, the project was already in a difficult place.\n\nIn 2021, a major fundraiser for Processing’s 20th anniversary brought unprecedented financial support, but it also sparked difficult conversations about the project’s future. In 2023, Processing’s historical maintainer, Ben Fry, cut ties with the project, and with no clear direction, development stalled for over a year. Many assumed Processing was dead.\n\nIt is not.\n\nThat same support that brought uncertainty also made recovery possible. Over the past year, a small group of contributors, with support from the Processing Foundation, has restarted development, modernized infrastructure, and begun the slow, difficult work of making Processing a sustainable open-source project again.\n\nProcessing will turn 25 in 2026, and we’re working to make it last for another 25 years!\n\nThis talk is an honest look at what it takes to keep a beloved open-source project alive, the progress we’ve made, and why the community’s role in its future is more critical than ever.",

This project enabled a complete “RE:imagination” of the UpStage code, removing its\ndependency on Flash, introducing new features and bringing it up to date with current technologies. The last\ntime we presented UpStage at LGM, in 2021, we had just begun this process; since then, the new platform\nhas been launched and development is ongoing.\n\nIn this presentation, our Lead Developer Gloria W. and\nUpStage Persister Helen Varley Jamieson will present the new platform and its features including its\nintegration of Jitsi for audio-visual streams, audience interaction and live text and drawing tools. Most\nrecently the developers have implemented Docker and made other improvements to the backend, to make\ninstallation of independent instances easier and testing more automated.\n\nAlongside the development work, UpStage continues to actively promote the use of open source tools by\nartists, and the involvement of artists in the development of our digital tools. This is ever more important as\nLLM (so-called AI) and the increasing hegemony of proprietary social and creative platforms force artists\ninto their paradigms. UpStage continues to be an independent, artist-led space for the “RE:imagination” of\nbetter worlds.\n\n## Links\n\n* [UpStage](https://upstage.org.nz/)\n* [UpStage: the cyberformance platform](https://upstage.live/)\n* [Mobilise/Demobilise](https://mobilise-demobilise.eu/)",

Most such display hardware allows the runtime loading or\nflashing of bitmap characters, but pitfalls abound.\n\nOptions and recommendations for both scenarios will be examined, with demos\ndrawn from vintage arcade fonts and the classic Xorg/X11 font suite.

They allow the designer to succinctly and efficiently model objects of arbitrary shape and smoothness. For converting these designs into physical objects, FreeCAD has a vast set of tools to operate on NURBS, both as planar curves and (with addons) as surfaces. However, the complications of NURBS can also cause a good amount of confusion, especially compared to other representations of splines, which may be more familiar to the user from other applications (which may include other CAE apps as well as more artistic tools like Inkscape).\n\nIn this talk, I discuss some of these common questions often seen in the issue tracker and forums, as well as best practices to follow for common workflows.

Due to their static nature, Hyper 8 sites are\ninherently fast, maintenance-free, long-term archivable (also working\noffline without a server, directly off disk) and compatible with pretty\nmuch every webhost (thereby easy to publish and move).\n\nIn this talk I want to take you on a whirlwind tour around the project:\nWho is this for? What was the motivation? How does this relate to\nPeerTube? What is being developed at the moment? Where is it going in\nthe future? What are the challenges, learnings, anecdotes so far? And so\non.

An extension allows you to attach all the basic components\nto objects, like particles, UV animations, water and much more. But you can\nalso share links, videos and audio right inside your 3D rooms.\n\nSoon another feature was added to the gtlf exporter, the Behavior Graph.\nIt enables interactivity via node-based logic and is only available in\nBlender 3D. It is the very feature we would like to present to you. If\nyou are used to Blender’s nodes graphs, you might feel right at home.\nHowever managing interactivity creates a distinct difference, since every\nnode needs to get triggered by events, be it player interaction or just\ntimer based.\n\n![BehaviorGraph Logo Illustration](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2025/img/events/re-imagining_3D_interactive_internet-BehaviorGraph.png)",

After having laid\nout the foundation, a brief overview of different usability evaluation methods is given. The main\npart of the presentation is about introducing two often used methods: On the one hand the heuristic\nevaluation as an example of a usability inspection method, and usability testing on the other hand.\nBoth methods can be used to find (potential) usability problems in a software. Whereas a heuristic\nevaluation is conducted by an expert following a check-list, a usability test needs end users who\nfulfill tasks to be conducted. After describing how both methods can be used individually, also a\npractical way to combining them is presented. The session will conclude with an overview of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each method.\n\n### Three takeaways of this session will be:\n\n* A basic awareness for usability/UX and the importance of evaluating it\n* An overview of the two major usability/UX evaluation methods heuristic evaluation and\nusability testing\n* A first idea how to use these methods for your/a software project\n\n## Target group\n\n* UX/usability laymen\n* Contributors to software",

What can we learn from these languages from current\ngraphic practices and perspectives? What context were these languages\ndeveloped in? Which aesthetics can be created with them today and which\ntools are needed to do so? How can the sharing culture of the FLOSS/LGM\ncommunity be applied to such old \"closed source\" devices? This artistic,\nmedia archeological, and auto-ethnographic research is part of the\nMaster Experimental Publishing (XPUB) in Rotterdam, where we, students and\nteachers, studied these languages together in the first 3 months of this\nyear on the most obsolete and almost discarded printing devices of our university.\n\nExpect a presentation about frustrations with serial connections, dust removal\nwith compressed air, porous plastic that disintegrates into small pieces,\nglitch aesthetic with PostScript and the practice of working within the obstacles\nof dying devices.

                "abstract": "So, is LGM all about libre tools that software developers make that\ndesigners and artists use to make creative work … ?  At previous LGMs\nwe’ve talked about open-source design feeding back into improving the\nlook, feel and usability of creative software.  But what about the\ntools used to write those tools? Can we link things back another step?\n\nCoding environments have barely changed in decades. Yet the complexity\nof software produced in them has risen exponentially. The disconnect\nfrom cause to effect has become ever greater. All software has bugs,\nmost bugs involve software doing exactly what it was told to do.\nSometimes they eat your work, sometimes they kill people.\n\nThe title of this talk is partly “borrowed” from an article that\nappeared in The Atlantic in 2017. But is it all hyperbole? This talk\nwas originally proposed for the cancelled LGM in 2020 - the landscape\nmay have evolved since then, such as in the growth of AI, but has it\nimproved?  Let’s consider some of the issues. And ongoing experiments\nin user interaction, liveness and design in various open-source tools\nthat are seeking to change coding for the better.\n\nThis talk may cover some of the ideas in play. But it certainly won’t\nhave the right answers. It probably hasn’t even found the right\nquestions. But just maybe it’s time to help save the world from code.",

We aimed for a project using three colors,\nand decided to go for spot color printing - using libre graphics tools, mainly\nQGIS for the design of the map, and Scribus for layout elements and to prepare\nthe pdfs for printing.\n\nWe also used Inkscape to vectorize some small illustrations, as well as\nGhostscript to check and sometimes fix the resulting PDFs.\n\nThen, once we decided that it would be spot color printing, we had to find\nout a workflow from QGIS to Scribus in order to produce PDFs for spot-color\nprinting. It was not without a few obstacles that we encountered, as both\nQGIS and Scribus present limitations in terms of color processing or vector\nrendering.\n\nWe will present our productive investigation into both QGIS and Scribus,\ndescribe how we use QGIS functionalities to optimize the maps for spot color\nprinting and show the tips and tricks we learned along the way - and share\nthe results, hoping to inspire other mapmakers around to give it a try.\n\n![A](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2025/img/events/printing_maps_with_spot_colors-feYCQ39ktaCeaGSR.png)",
