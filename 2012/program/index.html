        The ColorHug was announced in November 2011 as a 100% open source colorimeter device. The first 50 prototypes were lovingly hand soldered by myself and assembled by my wife in our spare bedroom. Since then, we've shifted from small hand-made batches to automated machines and started making production quantities. The community has welcomed the open hardware, with a vibrant community fixing bugs and adding new features and the project has blossomed into a healthy ecosystem.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is my first foray into producing open source hardware, and in this talk I'll explain the first-hand experienced intracacies of setting up an open hardware company, and what direction I see the project going in. We'll cover topics like automated firmware upgrades and complicated things like CCMX files, but without getting too bogged down with all the calculations. I'll show lots (and lots) of pictures and will try to avoid writing any words in my slides. I'll show all stages of development, from breadboard to automated pick and place machines, along with all the new software UIs and try to keep the talk lighthearted and fun.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There will be time left for questions and discussion.

        SVG 1.1 is now widely implemented, and has some (minimal, optional) support for ICC colours. In the main though it is an sRGB system. SVG2 adds a conformance class for full ICC support (v2 and v4) including named colours, direct specification in LAB or LCHab, and interpolation in LAB or LCHab. Unmanaged device-specific colour is also supported.

        The colord project has had an amazingly successful year, and is now installed by default on the Fedora, OpenSuse, Ubuntu and other distributions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In this talk I will quickly introduce why color management is important and then outline the many new features that we've introduced over the last 12 months, including automatic device to profile matching, native sensor drivers and the new profile metadata that is supported by GNOME Color Manager and some other tools. I will outline the future direction of colord, and hopefully try to explain my vision of a color management framework that "Just Works".

        Taxi DB - the ICC profile database
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In the past few years, color managment on free desktops made some huge steps forward. The dream is to get a desktop that is color managed and easy for users to handle: for example, if the user plugs in new hardware, such as a projector, the system should automatically retrieve the necessary ICC profile. For this goal to be possible ICC profiles must be available, preferably in a centralized place where the color managment system can find them: this is what Taxi DB does. Taxi DB was first implemented during GSoC 2011 and is now available under http://icc.opensuse.org/. DispcalGUI is integrated now as well; it can upload to the profile database. In this talk, we'll talk about how to use Taxi DB and the project's current status. 8

        sK1 project has been a bit silent for the most of this year. This is basically because we started it all over again. A year ago we decided to introduce major changes to both sK1, the vector graphics editor, and UniConvertor, the vector graphics conversion tool. After some analysis the decision was made to start everything from scratch although initially the plan was to do refactoring of both sK1 and UniConvertor.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This decision didn't come out of blue, because the source code inherited the architecture from Sketch/Skencil which was fine for late 90s, but didn't really resolved development issues for 2010s. Given amount of code base to go through we decided to just redo everything from start. That wasn't by any means an easy decision to make, but it was the only way out, especially since supporting the old toolkit was starting to take too much time. Mere 2-3 years ago we still had some hopes for Tcl/Tk 8.5-8.6, but alas it was a defeat. So we also had to find a new toolkit, and the choice was between GTK+ and Qt. Finally we have selected Gtk widgetset. Architecture was another issue we had to deal with, since we used to support sK1 and UniConvertor as two separate projects using duplicated code base. Also we designed a new file format appropriated to new document model  that is modeled after OpenDocument and called it PDXF (PrintDesign XML Format). Just like OpenRaster or OpenDocument files it's a ZIP archive with content.xml that describes the structure and nested folders for each type of embedded data.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As a result of deep project refactoring we are going to announce releases of three new or renewed applications:
        <br/>
        * UniConvertor 2.0 - deeply refactored version of UniConvertor 1.x branch
        <br/>
        * PrintDesign - succeeder of sK1 vector graphics editor
        <br/>
        * LinCuttor - new interactive tool for cutting plotters (something like Roland Studio)

        Last year, we were still celebrating the appearance of @font-face, allowing for the first time the use of non-standard typefaces on web pages. The explosion of libre work in typography thanks to initiatives such as the Open Font Library, the League of Movable Type or Google Web Fonts has been remarkable.
        <br/>
        At the same time, many other efforts appeared in order to deal with finer points in the challenge of good, elegant web typography, particularly in the forms of JavaScript libraries such as Lettering.js, Kerning.js or Colorfont.js. Recent projects like Flossmanuals's BookType propose to close the loop, generating fully typeset PDF documents out of collaboratively edited online books managed through a simple CMS. And we won't forget the enormous potential of Python scripts made to work with typefaces using Fontforge. It is an exciting time for type designers and typographers -- especially if you're on the libre side of things!
        <br/>
        Ana and Ricardo from Manufactura Independente will drive you through the history and recent developments in libre typography and type design, while providing many hints, technical hacks and advice on how to make the most of your designs; there will be a special focus on where and why using fonts and software that respect your freedom can elevate your design practice.

        Most software write their own configuration library

        to store and read settings or parameters. This leads

        to a system which is not well integrated.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I will present a working solution - Elektra - which
        <br/>
        overcomes this problem but leaves full control over
        <br/>
        the configuration to the programmer and the administrator.

        <br/>
        use it because of its modular approach which leads to benefits
        <br/>

       It's just something I hear come up a lot, usually not in a positive list, and not infrequently in close proximity to expletives.  Obviously there are other application types that rely on SANE or scanner access in general (e.g., OCR) that would have different requirements, but the graphics projects certainly deal with it more frequently.  My apologies if you're a huge SANE fan, but I see a lot of individuals complaining about different aspects of the design and the API -- it probably can't hurt to have that discussion in one place and see what comes out of it.

        Free software designers don't have a great set of integrated tools to work with to collaborate with each other and with the community on designs. We've come farther since the GNOME UX hackfest in 2010; let's make more progress towards fixing that. We'll review and demo the existing tools we do have, talk about their current status. and we'll also present our ideas for tool integration and further expansion and new tools.
        <br/>

        Some of the tools and ideas we'll cover include:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        (1) Sparkleshare: a git-backed, Dropboxlike system that automatically checks in and pushes files to a shared git repo.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        (2) Magic Mockup: a coffeescript/javascript you can insert into an SVG to enable interactive, click-through navigation functionality for mockups.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        (3) Design Hub: an idea and a rough ruby on rails prototype of a web interface that could potentially serve as a front end to Sparkleshare-backed git repos with design assets as well as serve as a front end to magic mockup assets.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        (4) Inkscape: We have many integration ideas for workflows between Inkscape's GUI and Magic Mockup, Sparkleshare, and Design Hub.

        With this talk I want to underline the importance of collective design process and to point out some proposal for the development of tools that enable the collective design of communicative artefacts.
        <br/>
        The study of popular spontaneous collective processes could be an important element for the development of enabling tools for collective design. The online community has find out many solution to overpass technical restraint linked with co-creation (e.g. Youtube and the difficulties of re-editing videos by other users), but still there is a lot to do for helping this need of collective creation.
        <br/>
        A lot of other insights could be obtained from the notes of tutors and designers during workshops or teaching experiences: from real problem to interesting solutions.
        <br/>
        The ideas exchange between software developers and designers  can help developing solutions to encourage people to construct a collective discourse more than an individual monologue.

        UpStage is an online platform for the real-time collaborative manipulation of digital graphics and other media into live performances for online audiences. The original software is now 8 years old, and during the last year developer Martin Eisenbarth has proposed a base concept and software architecture for a new engine, called DownStage, that will drive UpStage and potentially other variations of the platform as well. As UpStage is an unfunded and independent artists' project, we are seeking ways to support this development, and one source of support has come through a collaboration with the French digital artists' collective APO33.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In this talk Helen will give a brief introduction to UpStage, then Jenny will talk about APO33, their FLOSS developers' residencies and the collaboration with UpStage. Martin will then introduce the new engine, DownStage, and outline the ideas that motivate it, which include aiming for a modular and extensible structure that will more easily enable other developers to get involved.

        With the advent of Live Path Effects (LPEs) and especially the pattern-along-path LPE, it became possible to edit a path's stroke width live on-canvas. The pattern-along-path LPE was however not designed for variable stroke width use, resulting in a very awkward UI experience. Powerstroke is the name of an upcoming LPE dedicated to variable stroke width.
        <br/>
        The talk will start with a brief introduction to LPEs, how they work and what they can and cannot do, followed by a detailed discussion of the new Powerstroke LPE.

        The role of text within GIMP work ranges far beyond the text tool. However, the handling of text had never received any interaction design love… that is, until the beginning of 2012.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        That is when the GIMP UI design team ran a text handling design project, where solutions were methodically designed based on the right foundations.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Kate and Peter will show the steps the UI team took, and how much a deep understanding of GIMP, GIMP work and users informed the work. Besides that there will be plenty of take away points for other Libre Graphics projects.

       Colorfont.js is a jQuery script we developed to allow multi-coloured typography on the web. Along with the script, we designed a set of alternates to existing libre fonts for use with this library.
       <br/>
       One approach to create coloured type is to make variations around existing libre fonts. These variations are intented to use as overlays to the original, extensions to existing typefaces.A project such as this is only possible in the context of libre fonts and libre graphics, since creating and redistributing modified versions of fonts is a fundamental premise. In this spirit we propose a workshop around multi coloured type.
       <br/>
       We'll start with an overview of coloured type in graphic design, in order to collectively plan and sketch a set of new colorfonts to be created on the workshop. From there, we'll be making good use of Fontforge, Inkscape, Python scripting and Git version control in order to collaboratively build and release new designs for use with Colorfont.js (and many other tools!).

The open movie process delivers not just a film, but an entire production pipeline using Blender and Python for new custom tools, Mypaint, GIMP, Krita, Inkscape, Ardour, Ogg, Linux and more. Elephants Dream, the original open movie Bassam directed, proved it possible to make high quality 3D animation using libre tools in a studio setting. The Tube Open Movie is a new experiment, this time in distributed collaboration — a love letter to free software and open culture that marks their convergence with independent filmmaking.

        <br/>
        Remake is an opensource software. Homepage:

        Development and pathology of Graphic design in Iran

        Graphic design is an aggregative art and has a huge function in its international field. But, in Iran there isn’t any correct understanding of that because the different branches of this amazing art has not separately been defined and utilized to make the people see and receive its visual presence and affect in their life environments. The graphic designer has to be like a working machine and does work in all of the branches alone to propound the functions in society. Although the designer knows all of these branches, such as designing a logo, they are not supposed to be included in her work experience, because each of those requires academic professional experience. On the other hand, the communications has taken a special new visual form these days and although the Iranian designers haven’t still reached such technical development in the framework of graphic design profession, they have to follow the global direction and use digital technology but, the presence of digital technology has forced them to almost quit working with the previous tools and equip themselves to this new one, because the mentioned presence has been put into work before creating a suitable ground of acceptance for it. This occurrence has made the situation worse. Old hand designers have lost their jobs and even though just a few of them could have learnt skills in this regard, the power of computer is completely at the hands of young generation. Even though the history proves that they could have connected themselves to the global network, they have failed in some grounds. There still haven't been stated different specialties and management graphic design careers as if some people would like to call themselves “Art directors”. According to my research, some solutions can be offered for this problem.

         Many artists fear making a transition from proprietary software platforms on which they have honed their skills into the world of Libre Graphics software.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In this talk I will outline a process to develop a complete studio work flow around Libre software tools from project ideation to management to production.  In addition archiving will be addressed.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In addition I will give examples on how to teach the workflow to your artist peers and students.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Strategies and a time-line will be explained along with work examples.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I made the transition myself starting at LGM 2010 and want to share my experience and knowledge with other creatives.

         This talk is a tour of new open source software tools for font development that have been released over the past year.  Several independent projects have seen the light of day during the previous 12 months, each adding different features to the arsenal of free software utilities.  The heavy hitters includes Google's sfntly, the typography extensions for Inkscape, and newly GUI-empowered ttfautohint.  We can look at how each one contributes to the font development workflow, as well as where they are headed next.
