		<description>I was wondering about the possibility of having some kind of virtual presence at the conference.  I design polyhedral lamp shades decorated with fractal geometry using the Gimp, Inkscape, Blender and Python scripting. Do you think there would be an appropriate space for a lantern installation along with some kind of artist/designer statement display.  I would have to mail the lantern for assembly and installation by one of the conference volunteers.  Perhaps you could raffle it off it help cover some of the costs of the conference.  I would be happy to donate one to the cause considering the overwhelming contribution of the Open Source Graphic community to my artistic practice and budding business.</description>
