    Libre Graphics Meeting 2007 (LGM), a conference for developers and artists of leading open source graphics software, will bring together the top open source graphics application development teams, along with artists and print production users.
   </p>
   <p>
    LGM will take place at the Ecole Polytechnique from the 4th to the 6th of May 2007 and will be of interest to end-users, students of graphic design, editors, pre-press staff, printers and institutional archivists.
   </p>
   <p>
    What distinguishes Libre Graphics applications is that they are created with and developed exclusively on a base of open document formats and open source software. Proprietary formats from most commercial graphics applications used daily in the print world create a host of problems for end users and companies. Such problems include imperfect compatibility among operating system platforms and difficulty upgrading from older versions of files to newer versions, as well as the cost of licensing applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    These difficulties affect everyone in the print production workflow, from creators and editors to pre-press production workers. "In 2007, one can easily read a text that was written in the Middle Ages, but one can also count on encountering difficulties opening a file saved 20 years ago on a computer," noted Louis Desjardins, director and owner of a service bureau and printing company in Montreal.
   </p>
   <p>
    The challenges in solving these issues are technological, social, economic and political. LGM is the ideal place to come and learn the latest on these subjects and other related topics.
   </p>
   <p>
    FLOSS (Free libre open source software) is now mature enough that one can use it in real world production. As part of LGM, end users will give presentations to demonstrate the many ways in which they are using open source graphics applications to simplify their workflow. In addition, development teams will show their latest technology throughout LGM.
   </p>
   <p>
    Just as Open Office competes with MS Office, today, FLOSS graphics applications, such as GIMP, Krita and Scribus, are becoming attractive alternatives to well known proprietary graphics applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    Among the presenters will be:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Bassam Kurdali, producer of Elephant's Dream, created entirely via open
     source applications such as Blender - the leading 3D application.
    </li>
    <li>
     Peter Linnell, a pre-press IT consultant and author of the Scribus
     documentation, will present the latest professional features added to
     Scribus.
    </li>
    <li>
     Cedric Gemy, author of "GIMP Efficace" and a graphics professor, will
     give several short talks including why graphic artists should consider
     using open source software.
    </li>
    <li>
     Louis Suarez-Potts from Open Office.org will address Open Document and
     the importance of open document formats.
    </li>
    <li>
     Alain Boucher from the Bibliotheque et Archives Nationales du Quebec
     will address issues with archiving electronic documents.
    </li>
    <li>
     Raphael Meltz, editor and publisher of Le Tigre, the first national
     newspaper published entirely with open source applications, will
     present on his experiences and successes.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The organizers of LGM would be pleased to arrange interviews, for print and electronic journalists, with these and other speakers at the conference.
   </p>

<p>Issue date: 12 February 2007</p>
<p>
Building on the overwhelming success of last year's Libre Graphics Meeting in Lyon, France, key Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) graphics projects are pleased to announce the second Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM), to be held in Montréal, Québec, Canada, May 4—6, 2007 at École Polytechnique de Montréal.</p>
<p>
This year's LGM provides a venue where FLOSS graphics application developers, users and professional artists from all over the world meet to discuss collaboration, outline the future of the projects together, with the goal of increasing interaction between developers, professional graphics artists and print professionals to improve the steadily expanding FLOSS graphics' application ecosystem.</p>
<p>
This ecosystem consists of open source projects such as Blender - a 3D creation application, Scribus - a professional grade page layout application, GIMP - a versatile and mature image editor, Inkscape - a user friendly, yet powerful vector drawing application for SVG, Krita - a rapidly maturing "natural" painting application, Open Clip Art Library - a large public domain collection of freely available artwork, and many other projects focussed on graphics creation and editing.</p>
<p>
According to Louis Desjardins, a 20 year veteran of pre-press and print production and organiser of the conference: "LGM is a sure demonstration of the maturity of free and open source applications - even at a professional level. Not only that, never before have I seen such a close and amicable working relationship between the users of this kind of software and those who create it."
</p>
<p>Having experienced the whole evolution from camera ready galleys and manual stripping to the advent and evolution of DTP, he states: "We are now seeing Free Software emerge in a domain which was more or less closed before."
</p>
<p>Numerous companies and organisations are showing their support of LGM by means of sponsorship. They are convinced that LGM has a clear positive impact on the evolution of the projects present at the conference. LGM audience is increasing rapidly as we gather momentum. Sponsors have the opportunity to show their support to the community and get appropriate web and media exposure. This year they also have the opportunity to advertise in the LGM Brochure which will be entirely done using FLOSS.
</p>
<p>The conference offers presentations of various Free/Libre Open Source graphics projects, technology previews and talks on general issues such as open file formats. There will be informal brainstorming sessions and time for artists and developers to meet face to face and to work on common goals, which is a characteristic of the FLOSS world.
</p>
<p>LGM 2007 is putting out a call for participation, sponsorship, and discussion. The call for participation includes the submission of at most 2 paragraph presentation abstracts by interested projects and individuals. All types of presentations will be considered, including topics as diverse as collaboration, power-user art techniques, engineering talks, graphics business best practices, and other relevant topics.
