				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While freedom in digital graphic design is a primary topic at Libre Graphics Meeting, applications outside the digital world are also fascinating to see! So there will be an opportunity to hear about (and hack with) the fashion pattern design tool <a title="Valentina Project Website" href="http://valentina-project.blogspot.ru/2013/12/blog-post_10.html">Valentina</a> this year.</p>
<p>Susan Spencer Conklin first brought up the topic of free software for fashion design at Libre Graphics Meeting 2010 in Brussels and a year later in Montreal she demonstrated her own software made as part of the <a href="http://www.taumeta.org/">Tau Meta Tau Physica</a> project. She programmed the project in Python and implemented the results visually into Inkscape through extensions to be able to output the patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FSjacket1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-633" alt="Valentina Pattern Example" src="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FSjacket1-800x528.png" width="480" height="317" /></a></p>
<p>However, there are often many paths to a solution, and it wasn&#8217;t long before another option became available.</p>
<p>Roman Telezhinsky started working on his own pattern design tool called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dismine/valentina">Valentina </a>as he was studying in a college. Valentina will be introduced at this years Libre Graphics Meeting to the audience and because its still in an early stage, there will be a special hackfest for working on it!</p>

One of the projects which will have its first appearance at LibreGraphicsMeeting this year, is Magic Lantern. Magic Lantern is a free software add-on for most newer Canon EOS cameras. It allows you to get the most out of your camera and it adds many extra features that are not included from the factory by Canon.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/46188010">Magic Lantern version 2.3 Promo</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/magiclanternfm">MagicLanternFM</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<div>The project will show in a talk what Magic Lantern is and they will also offer a workshop focusing mostly on advanced photography with Magic Lantern&#8217;s unique functionality like raw overlays, ETTR, bracketing, dual ISO, focus stacking, the manual focus tools, long exposures and fisheye correction. Of course you can bring your camera and they will help to install Magic Lantern on it.</div>
<p><a title="Register for LibreGraphicsMeeting 2014" href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/register/">Join us in Leipzig</a> at the <strong>2014 LibreGraphicsMeeting</strong> to give your Canon EOS camera a little more freedom.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2012">2012 Libre Graphics Meeting</a> in Vienna, Richard Hughes presented a progress report on the <a href="http://www.hughski.com/">ColorHug</a>, his open hardware colorimeter. For over 2200 Linux users (and counting!), the Open Hardware ColorHug colorimeter has been an inexpensive way to calibrate monitors. Richard returns to LGM this year to talk about his newest project, a progression of the work on ColorHug, the <a href="http://www.hughski.com/colorhugplus.html">ColorHug+</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ColorHug+.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-501 aligncenter" alt="ColorHug+ Prototype" src="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ColorHug+-800x255.jpg" width="800" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>The ColorHug+ is a mini-spectrograph with UV switched illuminants, allowing it to profile all manner of displays and printers. This allows for a complete look at colour management throughout the workflow. In this presentation Richard will be discussing the technology change for the ColorHug+, the higher price (£300 for the ColorHug+ vs. £60 for the ColorHug), and will walk through the requirements for building a device with sufficient accuracy and precision. Richard will also walk through a brief history of the project and display photos of early prototypes of the ColorHug+.</p>
<p><a title="Register for LibreGraphicsMeeting 2014" href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/register/">Join us in Leipzig</a> at the <strong>2014 Libre Graphics Meeting</strong> for a chance to meet Richard and see his presentation on the ColorHug+!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Libre Graphics Meeting tries to bring in talks or presentations from the local community each year, and there is a fantastic presentation this year of the work done by Sebastian König recreating a 500 year old manikin with Blender for the <a href="http://www.grassimuseum.de/en/exhibitions.html">GRASSI Museum für Angewandte Kunst</a> in Leipzig.</p>
<div id="attachment_462" style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/manikin1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-462 " alt="Manikin" src="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/manikin1-800x532.jpg" width="560" height="372" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The original figure was created in 1525 of wood and string.<br /> (Image courtesy of Sebastian König CC-BY)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left">As detailed in the original post on <a href="http://www.blendernation.com/2013/12/16/digital-recreation-of-500-year-old-manikin-figurine/">Blendernation</a>, the original figure dates from 1525 and is an intricate creation of wood and strings that made the figure fully pose-able (even toes and fingers).  Due to its extreme age the figure is fragile, so it was scanned using computer tomography.  Starting from this scan, Sebastian then proceeded to use Blender to re-create the model digitally.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">This not only allowed the model to be manipulated without fear of damaging the original, it was also able to allow the museum some insight into how it functions.  For more details of the process and results, have a look at the <a href="http://www.blendernation.com/2013/12/16/digital-recreation-of-500-year-old-manikin-figurine/">original post on Blendernation</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">For an opportunity to hear Sebastian speak further about the process and results, come <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2014/register">visit us in Leipzig</a> for the 2014 <strong>Libre Graphics Meeting</strong>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Call for Content was opened last November for submission of talks, workshops, or hackfests. Now the submission period is closed and we have the hard task ahead of us of selecting the talks and arranging them into a program schedule.</p>
<p>We have over <strong>80 submissions</strong> to consider, and it&#8217;s going to be difficult to select the best ones!</p>
<p>This year we got many submissions around 3D graphics and <a title="Blender 3D" href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, but we also have darktable participating as a project. There are some new exciting things like the <a title="Magic Lantern Free Canon Firmware" href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/">Magic Lantern</a> free firmware project as well as the usual topics such as Color Management, Font Design, and Desktop Publishing.</p>
<p>We will inform all of the speakers of acceptance by January 25<sup>th</sup>. The schedule will be published after all of the speakers have confirmed their session and timeslots. This should be by the end of January or early February.</p>
<p>We know you&#8217;re excited to see what will be happening at this years Libre Graphics Meeting, so over the course of the next few days we will be publishing some sneak peaks of the program. Stay Tuned!</p>
