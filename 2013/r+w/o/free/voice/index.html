     On the surface, they look pretty similar (especially nowadays). Beyond that, it's a world of ethical and code difference.

     It's so much better AFTER you config and install zillions of plugins.

    <li>
     I love different tools for similar tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
     The Nexus 4 is just like a iPhone, isn't it? Same thing (a smartphone) to do the same thing (make calls, send messages, run apps), but working in a different way. GIMP is not (and has never tried to be) a drop-in replacement for Photoshop, which is why some of the people who have invested (in time, money and experience) in Photoshop struggle to get to grips with it. And yes, Photoshop can do some things that GIMP can't, but if people are taught skills, rather than trained in the use of a particular piece of software, then their knowledge is more transferrable, and as these missing features are added and matured, people gain a very valuable thing indeed: choice.
    </li>
    <li>
     You can accomplish a lot of the same tasks but it's different in some ways.
    </li>
    <li>
     In general yes, but GIMP is maintained by a community of voluntaries and not owned by a company.
    </li>
    <li>
     Photoshop is commercial software and GIMP is Free Software, that means the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

     They aren't bad. In the short term they can even be the better solution. However you're dependant on one company to develop the tools you're using. This can work ok but you don't have much influence over the direction those tools go. Also you are helpless if the company goes bankrupt, is bought by another company or simply discontinues the product (or service).
    </li>
    <li>
     If crimes are so bad, why do people keep committing them?
    </li>
    <li>
     Because they learned to use those programs in art school, because art school chose to teach those programs, because companies ask for them in the job market, because companies think these programs are taught in art schools, and the cycle repeats.
    </li>
    <li>

     If cars do harm to the environment, why are people still using them?
    </li>
    <li>
     Proprietary programs are not bad, they are restrictive about your freedom: if you want more freedom about your artwork, you should use free softwares. Most people don't know any alternative, and some people despise free software because they aren't commercial. So most people still use them... help us spread the world about libre graphics!

     If they really offer the same hackability - including the freedom to resell your hacked versions for any price - then they are Free Software.
    </li>
    <li>
     Proprietary tools do NOT, in point of fact, offer you the same 'hackability.' Or else they'd be Free Software.
    </li>
    <li>
     Freedom!
    </li>
    <li>
     Proprietary tools exist at the whim of their creators - if they decide to discontinue a product, you're facing a dead-end. In particular, with proprietary tools that require activiation/validation (both initial, and throughout the time you're using them) you're at the mercy of the creators running the activation servers - if they shut these down, your tools suddenly stop working, or you'll be unable to reinstall them if you need to. Open Source tools aren't bound to a single "creator" - if the original project team are no longer interested in supporting or developing a tool, new people can take over. OS projects only die when *nobody* is interested in them any more - and even then, they can come back to life as soon as someone does take an interest.
    </li>
    <li>
     Proprietary software means, fundamentally, that you don't control what it does; you can't study the source code, or change it.

     None. You could theoretically learn how to drive a car without any lessons. You could teach yourself how to play a musical instrument just by messing with it.You could figure out how to set the clock on your microwave by hitting all of the buttons. You don't *need* to read any manuals, but it's usually the quickest route to productivity. :)

     Does it matter if you get to vote for your leaders, as long as they're benevolent?

    <li>
     Yes -- to be able to collaborate with others, to share it freely, to make sure anyone can always open and edit it, even if the software's original developer no longer maintains the project (e.g. Nina Paley, author of Sita Sings the Blues, is forced to use an old Mac OS X version just to be able to use Macromedia Flash).

     Yes.

     In some cases, a command line can be a faster way to interact with a software because you don't have to load up a large interface with 30 options to achieve a single result. You can just type in what you need really quick and bam-an outcome.

     Empower individuals and communities to create their own money. All money in Ripple is explicitly represented as debt, with transactions simply consisting of balances being shifted on a series of imaginary credit lines from the payer to the receiver. In order to explain how this works in practice, consider a simple example. Suppose there are two friends, B and C, taking a road trip, and they both decided to bring along a friend of their own; B brought his friend A and C brought his friend D. A knows B, but has never met C and D before and they may well never meet again, and similarly D has never met A and B. Now, suppose that A and D are out getting a coffee, but D does not have money to pay.

     There are so many GNU/Linux distributions because nobody is preventing you from taking the code and making your own.
    </li>
    <li>
     Here's a thought: start with the ten most popular one on DistroWatch, do a little casual comparison, and settle on what seems most interesting to you. As a designer, probably nothing will suit you better than the Fedora Design Suite (a "spin" of Fedora).
    </li>

     You should totally switch to GNU/Linux, though.

    <li>
     The most popular libre graphics tools will run like a normal Mac app, yes. If the one you are interested in does not, it might run with 'X11,' a unix compatibility tool; and you can run a GNU+Linux system on your Mac desktop with the libre Virtual Box tool, which is convenient but may be slow. If you need speed, you can install GNU+Linux directly and reboot into it when you need to.

     Apparently not. There have been complaints that FLOSS is most accessible to comparativley well-off "first worlders" (with slogans like "FLOSS is made by the first world for the first world"). Poor people are sometimes restricited to using pirated and trojaned proprietary software, because their access to software is via other people who want to gain profits from their desperate need to be connected.
    </li>
    <li>
     Is poor people made of free hardware?
    </li>
    <li>
     Realistically, no, it isn't. It's for smart, creative, middle class people.
    </li>
    <li>
     It is! I'm poor too!
    </li>
    <li>
     No, 'poor' people do not this software at all, the only use Facebook and watch TV programs like Gran Hermano 14.
    </li>
    <li>
     Obviously is for smart people, so... not poor at all.
    </li>
    <li>
     Being precise, it's just the opposite. Poor people usually don't have enough time for taking the "risky way".

     Popularity and profits is always easier to achieve if you are willing to trade off some ethics.
    </li>
    <li>
     GNU/Linux is actually the most used operating systems, it runs on most servers, DVD players, etc. Still, most people don't know about those free black boxes. So I guess the answer is no.

     No. You are free to choose what you want to use. But what's the point on using free software and using non-free fonts? Free software is not about software any more, the whole point now is free culture.
    </li>
    <li>
     Not if you don't want to. But there are enough free fonts on openfontlibrary and elsewhere to do just about anything
    </li>
    <li>
     You do not have to, but why not?
    </li>
    <li>
     It might. There are lots of good ones. But you can also use the proprietary ones.

     Hello! I pasted here some information for you! It's from the text you get when putting 'man aptitude' into your command line: Description aptitude is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package system. It allows the user to view the list of packages and to perform package management tasks such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages. Actions may be performed from a visual interface or from the command-line.
    </li>

     Good question. What is this weird packaging system that goes on in the back of the os and only super users can config their computers?

     Nobody wants you to give up Photoshop if you can afford it and are happy with it. In fact, many users of other apps will actually be happy if you stick to it instead of entering their community and bicker about "why $app is not more like Photoshop".
